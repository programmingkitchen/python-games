### rock-game-foundation.py
This is a foundation game that illustrates several techniques:

* Game flow is controlled in the main() method and this is called using the best practice using __name__.
* An infinite loop in the main method that prompts to "Play Again."
* Global scores that are referenced in the function by
using the "global" keyword.
* User input validation and looping when an invalid choice is entered.  When a valid choice is entered the function (and the loop) exits with the return.

TODO
* Add winner logic to pick_winner()
